<h3>Project Description:</h3>
StreetsLA is responsible for sweeping over 6,500 centerline miles of street
and over 600 miles of bike lanes citywide. The street sweeping operations
can be divided into three major types of routes.
<ul>
<li>Over 800 weekly restricted parking routes (meaning streets are
  posted with “No Parking” signs that state the day and time the
  street will be swept, and citations will be given to vehicles parked
  along the route)</li>
<li>Over 300 non-restricted routes (meaning there are no parking
  restrictions for street cleaning on these routes)</li>
<li>Over 100 Early A.M. routes (which are typically located in business
  districts to limit the disruption of business and traffic flow, and
  which do not have posted parking restrictions)
  StreetsLA is interested in a data-driven assessment of street sweeping
  routes across all 15 council districts. Analysis should apply an equity lens
  while considering operational constraints and service demand.</li>
</ul>
